# Snowman-Meltdown
Snowman Meltdown is a Python command-line word guessing game inspired by Hangman. The player must guess the secret word one letter at a time. For each incorrect guess, the snowman begins to melt, stage by stage, using ASCII art. The game ends when the player either successfully guesses the full word or the snowman completely melts.

This project was built to practice Python fundamentals, modular programming, and version control with Git and GitHub. It also demonstrates code readability, error handling, and future test automation possibilities
